# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Steps to Deploy on Vercel

1. **Make sure you have the `vercel.json` file** (already created) with the following content:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. **Build the project locally** to ensure it works:
```bash
npm run build
```

3. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
   - Make sure the build command is: `npm run build`
   - Make sure the output directory is: `build`
   - Deploy!

## Common Issues Fixed

- ✅ Added `vercel.json` for React Router support
- ✅ All images are properly referenced
- ✅ Build process works without warnings
- ✅ All dependencies are up to date

## If deployment still fails:

1. Check the Vercel build logs for specific errors
2. Make sure all image files are committed to your repository
3. Verify that the build command completes successfully locally
